Description
------------

**What actually does the script do?**

It will index each letter in a text to words. 
List of words in which particular letter occurs, should be sorted alphabetically.

**Assumptions:**
- word: comprised of latin alphabet characters [a-z]|[A-z]| separated by whitespace character (so characters
like '-', ':' etc. are going to be skipped)
- does not have to take letter case into consideration
- words that occur many times in a text must be presented only once in output 

**Solution:**

We do not have any restrictions about what matters for us regarding the algorithm design, so the simpliest 
implementation has been chosen.

We are iterating over a list of extracted, valid words from input. Word is split up to an array of characters 
and now we are ready to create a proper structure. Character is a key, Word is an element of a list which in turn is 
a value. Depending if list is empty we create a list or just update their rows. Every update of the list runs sorting 
algorithm to make everything in order.
